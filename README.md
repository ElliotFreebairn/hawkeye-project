# Hawkeye Card Game

## The Card Game (KARMA)

Karama is a game which lies close to my heart and was a staple of my childhood

Creating a higher/lower card game might have been much easier, however I'm really interested in how developing a program with the complex rules and abilities Karma offers.

## Why CLI not GUI?

Building Karma instead of higher/lower meant more time spent programming the logic and core game, so to focus on that, I chose a simple CLI interface instead of a GUI.

## How to play

Here is a link to the rules of Karma: https://gamerules.com/rules/karma/

There are 2 - 6 players in a game of Karma

You can either autoplay (karma is a long game!) or play manually with your friends.

## How to run
`` javac *.java ``
`` java App ``
